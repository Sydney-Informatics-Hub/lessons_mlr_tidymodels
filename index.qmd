### Prerequisites

- This course assumes intermediate R knowledge. This workshop is for you if:

  + You can use the `magrittr` pipe %>%;
  + You are familiar with functions from `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`;
  + You can read data into R, transform and reshape data, and make a wide variety of graphs.
- We expect participants to have some exposure to basic statistical concepts, but NOT intermediate or expert familiarity with modeling or machine learning;
- You need your own laptop with R and a few key packages installed. See [setup instructions](00_setup.qmd) for more details.
