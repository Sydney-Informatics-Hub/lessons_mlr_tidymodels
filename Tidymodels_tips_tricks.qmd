The [usemodels package](https://usemodels.tidymodels.org) is a helpful way of quickly creating code snippets to fit models using the tidymodels framework.
Given a simple formula and a data set, the use_* functions can create code that appropriate for the data (given the model).
The package includes these templates:
```{r}
library(usemodels)
ls("package:usemodels", pattern = "use_")
```
