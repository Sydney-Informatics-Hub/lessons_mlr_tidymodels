------------------------------------------------------------------------

This training provide a gentle introduction to supervised machine learning (**classification** and **regression**) with R using the **tidymodels** framework, a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles.

Participants will learn how to build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models.

The focus is on teaching intuitive explanations of the models, key concepts in machine learning and best practices for predictive modeling.

Participants will get hands-on experience using core tidymodels packages like **parsnip**, **rsample**, recipes, **yardstick**, **tune**, and **workflows**.
