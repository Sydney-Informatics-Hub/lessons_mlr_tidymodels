# Raw data folder

For projects where the data comes in in a sequential manner, it's important to keep track of when what piece of data came in, and what the caveats are. This readme should explain all this.

Ideally, this folder is either flat (with all datasets stored in the root) or organised with only one level of folders (if there are many files per dataset, such as many shapefiles), with each folder corresponding to a data type (or a date when data was provided).
