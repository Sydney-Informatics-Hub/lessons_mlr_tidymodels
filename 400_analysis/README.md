# Analyses

This folder should contain the analyses. Each exploration should correspond to 
one (and only one, ideally) `.Rmd` or `.R` file. Analysis files should be named in the
standard way. 

The analyses files should read data files from the [200_data_clean](./200_data_clean) folder, but should write to the [300_data_analysed](./300_data_analysed) folder.
