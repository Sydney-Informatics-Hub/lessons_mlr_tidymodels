## Emails and meetings

Please save ALL client communication about a project (including the scoping ones!) into this folder.

### Emails

- Please save the .eml format from outlook (yymmddhhmm_subject.eml) as well as a text export .txt with the same filename. 
- The blah script in blah folder will help you do this conversion.
- Also make sure to save any attachments as yymmddhhmm.pdf (or whatever) to make it clear from which email it came. 

### Meeting notes

- Please save meeting notes in the yymmdd_meeting.md format. A template for meeting notes is provided. 
- Make sure you email around the meeting notes after each meeting.
- TODO: add easy way to add these notes directly to JIRA/Confluence.
